The project is a recreation of Valve's Portal effect created within Unity.

The system is created using two portal prefabs. A portal prefab is made up of a mesh with an attached collider as well as a seperate camera and a particle effect. Each portal uses a material created using a render texture. When both portals are created within the scene each render texture uses the opposite portal's camera to render what eachother can view to give the illusion of being able to see in one and out the other.
